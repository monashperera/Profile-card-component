### What I learned

This project thought me how to use different background image.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
body {
    background-image: url('../images/bg-pattern-top.svg'), url('../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg');
    background-position: left -15vw top -30vw, right -25vh bottom -72vh;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
